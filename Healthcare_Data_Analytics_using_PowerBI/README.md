# Hospital ER Patient Healthcare Analysis
This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of hospital Emergency Room (ER) patient data, uncovering crucial insights into patient wait times, satisfaction, and overall hospital efficiency. The report explores various aspects of patient care, including demographics, appointment types, and healthcare demands over time.

## Project Overview
The dataset consists of hospital ER data, including patient demographics, appointment types, wait times, and patient satisfaction scores. The goal of this analysis is to help identify patterns, trends, and factors that impact patient experience and hospital efficiency. The findings provide valuable insights for healthcare administrators and practitioners to make data-driven decisions to improve patient care and hospital management.

## Key Findings
- Average Wait Time: The report examines how long patients typically wait before their appointments./n
- Patient Satisfaction: Analysis of average patient satisfaction scores to identify factors contributing to a positive patient experience. Recommendations for enhancing patient satisfaction based on data-driven insights.
- Total Patient Visits Monthly: Overview of patient visit patterns every month. It is important to understand the dynamics of healthcare demand over time to optimize resource allocation and staffing.
- Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments: Differentiation between appointments involving administrative processes (e.g., check-ins, paperwork) and non-administrative appointments.
- Exploration of how these factors impact wait times and overall patient satisfaction.
- Referrals and Walk-In Patients: Examination of the balance between patients referred to specific departments and those who arrive without a referral â€” analysis of how these factors affect the overall patient experience.
- Patient Visits by Age Group and Race: Distribution of patient visits across different age groups and races. Insights into the diversity of healthcare needs and preferences, supporting more personalized and equitable healthcare delivery.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:

Date: The date and time of the patient's appointment.  
Patient ID: A unique identifier for each patient.   
Patient Gender: The gender of the patient (Male/Female).
